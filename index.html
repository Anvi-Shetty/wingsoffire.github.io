<h2> Tsunami </h2>
<p> Tsunami is a snarky, brisk, buoyant, SeaWing. She does not typically wait for permission before acting. She also doesn not trust prophecies or animus magic, and she is angry, ferocious, and a famously formidable warrior. She shouts often and is not terrific at answering polite questions, and she somethimes makes specific, alarmingly detailed threats. Although she is quite confident, Tsunami often questions herself and wonders is she is too rash and impatient. Overall, Tsunami is brave and strong, although she can be quiet bossy and stubborn.  She is the headmistress of Jade Mountain Academy and is currently traveling across the sea from Pyrrhia towards Pantala as one of the eleven representatives chosen to go on the journey. <a href= "tsunami.html"> ...

<h2> Glory </h2>
<p> Glory is often depicted as snarky, snide, sarcastic (being called the "Queen of Sarcasm" by Sunny), bold, aloof, judgemental, brave, and impatient with anyone lazy of stupid (specifically her Rainwing subjects.) When Moonwatcher suggested that Glory return to the RainWing village for her own saftey, she snorted as thought she was sure she could handle anything. She has a steely ferocity about her, and Deathbringer described her as reckless. However she is thoughful and fair. She has been shown to care about her friends and has become calmer and more composed since becoming a queen. It also has made her respect the peace of the rainforest, as shown when Darkstalker came with the NightWings. Glory is shown to be brave and selfless, insisting on being one of the first RainWings to enter the NightWings island suring the rescue of the RainWing prisoners in The Dark Secret. She is currently the queen of the RainWings and the NightWing and is currently in a relationship with Deathbringer. <a href= "glory.html"> ... Read more.</a> </p>

<h2> Starflight </h2>
<p> Starflight is often a nervous NightWing, but he is determined and is willing to fight for his students. He has been described as being a studious dragon. He is extraordinarily intelligent and is considered a know-it-all by his friends. Moonwatcher describes his thoughts as sonstantly busy, ticking through all the things he needed to do to get the library completely read. However, Starflight can sometimes be annoying, according to the other dragonets of destiny, as he tends to regard academics very seriously. He was also often regared as cowardly and meek, avoiding confrontaion and usually preferring the easiest, most peaceful solutions. In The Dark Secret, Starflight frequently felt ashamed of his cowardice and wished that he could have a braveness similar to Tsunami's. However, he eventually forced himself to move past his fear in order to rescue Deathbringer and Splendor from the NightWing dungeonsn. He cares strongly about his friends and is affectionate towards his loved ones. Unfortunately, after being caught in a volcanic eruption on the NightWing island, Starflight was permanently blinded. He is currently working in Jade Mountain Academy as a librarian. <a href= "starflight.html"> ... Read more.</a> </p>

<h2> Sunny </h2>
<p> Sunny often attempts to be stern, but she is unambitious, agreeable SandWing. And wants to believe the best in every dragon. She is passionate and disapproves of violence. She has an excitable, bright, bubbly, empathetic, cheerful, good-natured, kind-hearted, and optimistic personality. Her ability to always seek the positive side in even the worst of situations led to her friends underestimating her while growing under mountain. Although it is sometimes inconvenient, Sunny often feels compassion for dragons with evil intentions and believes that beneath every seemingly bad dragon is always a backstory or a reason to be that way. She is usually underdog, because of her size and cheerful disposition, be she proves that she is intelligent and fearless.  Sunny also seems to be devoted to making the world a better place. This is shown when after Morrowseer explained that the prophecy was fake, she didn't become relieved and plan to live and ordinary life. Sunny said that she wanted to stop the war and liked being destined to end it. Although still kind, hopeful, and compassionate, Sunny has become more firm, confident, and direct like her mother. <a href= "sunny.html"> ... Read more.</a> </p>
