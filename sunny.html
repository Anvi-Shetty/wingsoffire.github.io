<h2> Sunny </h2>
<p> Sunny often attempts to be stern, but she is unambitious, agreeable SandWing. And wants to believe the best in every dragon. She is passionate and disapproves of violence. She has an excitable, bright, bubbly, empathetic, cheerful, good-natured, kind-hearted, and optimistic personality. Her ability to always seek the positive side in even the worst of situations led to her friends underestimating her while growing under mountain. Although it is sometimes inconvenient, Sunny often feels compassion for dragons with evil intentions and believes that beneath every seemingly bad dragon is always a backstory or a reason to be that way. She is usually underdog, because of her size and cheerful disposition, be she proves that she is intelligent and fearless.  Sunny also seems to be devoted to making the world a better place. This is shown when after Morrowseer explained that the prophecy was fake, she didn't become relieved and plan to live and ordinary life.
