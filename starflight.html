<h2> Starflight </h2>
<p> Starflight is often a nervous NightWing, but he is determined and is willing to fight for his students. He has been described as being a studious dragon. He is extraordinarily intelligent and is considered a know-it-all by his friends. Moonwatcher describes his thoughts as sonstantly busy, ticking through all the things he needed to do to get the library completely read. However, Starflight can sometimes be annoying, according to the other dragonets of destiny, as he tends to regard academics very seriously. He was also often regared as cowardly and meek, avoiding confrontaion and usually preferring the easiest, most peaceful solutions. In The Dark Secret, Starflight frequently felt ashamed of his cowardice and wished that he could have a braveness similar to Tsunami's. However, he eventually forced himself to move past his fear in order to rescue Deathbringer and Splendor from the NightWing dungeonsn. He cares strongly about his friends and is affectionate towards his loved ones. Unfortunately, after being caught in a volcanic eruption on the NightWing island, Starflight was permanently blinded. He is currently working in Jade Mountain Academy as a librarian. <a href= "starflight.html"> ... Read more.</a> </p>
